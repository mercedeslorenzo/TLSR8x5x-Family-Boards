Telink has designed several kinds of boards which are helpful to evaluate at the beginning of projects. After customers are familar with the boards and stock, customers can develop theirs own projects in many different field basing on the boards.

## 1. TLSR8X5X development board

TLSR8X5X development board is a kind of generic board. it support many functions, including RF, audio in/out, gpio, button and so on. So it is easy to develop TLSR8X5X corresponding application.

## 2. TLSR8X5X dongle

TLSR8X5X dongle supports USB connector, 5 leds, 2 buttons. So it is easy to used as a master demo in BLE RCU projects, a bulb demo in lighting projects and so on.
